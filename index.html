The story follows a spy who has to "build a family" to execute a mission, not realizing that the girl he adopts as a daughter and the woman he agrees to be in a fake marriage with are a mind reader and an assassin, respectively. It has been serialized biweekly for free on the Shōnen Jump+ application and website since March 25, 2019, with the chapters collected and published into 7 tankōbon volumes by Shueisha as of June 2021.
